# LudoGame
Requirements:
● A ludo game can be started with 2 or more players.
● At the start of a game, each player is assigned 4 pieces of particular color.
● A ludo game consists of a dice.
● A dice has 6 sides, but you can think about ways to support different types of dice that
have more than 6 sides.
● Each player can roll dice when his/her turn comes.
● Upon rolling the dice, they receive a number from the dice.
● If the player gets 6 (in case of 6 sided dice), then the player can either choose to unlock
a piece or can move his/her any other unlocked pieces.
● For any other number the player can move any of his/her unlocked pieces.
● If any placer moves one of his/her pieces into a location where another player has
his/her piece and the location is not a safe location, then the other player’s piece will get
locked.
● Upon unlocking a piece, each player puts the piece at position/location zero.
● Upon getting a number from turn, when a player moves his/her piece, it progresses the
amount of steps of the number.
● The ludo game has a track or certain length. If the player’s piece reaches the end of the
track (location/places are just one step of that track), then the piece gets mature.
● When some player has all his/her pieces matured, then he/she wins the game.
